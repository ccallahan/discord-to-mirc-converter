# Discord to mIRC Converter

Converts Discord log dumps in JSON format generated by [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/) to mIRC format, which then can be used with programs like PISG or mIRCStats to make stats.

## Usage

First, initialize a VirtualEnv and install the needed package:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ .venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run it as shown:

```bash
$ JSON_PATH=/path/to/file .venv/bin/python3 processor.py > log.txt
```

It will take the JSON dump specified in the environment variable and output it to stdout, which you can then redirect to wherever you choose.
